# FireðŸ”¥Note

Firenote is a simnple browser based text editor project. It features a pleasant minimal interface with large, fonts and hassle free & reliable background saving to localstorage, without requiring sign-in.

Functionality is straightforward: just visit [firenote](https://rkooyenga.github.io/firenote) and start typing. You can leave the page, close the browser, hit refresh, etc...and your note will still be there. Optionally you can also export a text file to your download directory for a hard copy.

``note: although this project was 1st built many years ago, I'm actively re-writing it. So it changes often while I settle on a new look and add some new features.``
