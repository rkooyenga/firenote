# FireðŸ”¥Note

Firenote is a no bullshit note taker, and lightweight text editor by Ray Kooyenga. It relies on local storage for fast resilient saving of data. 

ðŸ”§ It's built lean. Vanilla Javascript and CSS, no JQuery, no Bootstrap, no heavy dependencies.

### :radio_button: Use Case
Firenote is not a ubiquitious solution to mold jello, pickup chicks, and replace your ti-92 calculator. It's a simple dedicated tool for an exact need, which it fulfills better than any other solution thus far employed for this specific use-case of last-second saving when things are going down and memory is tight. 

In it's earliest incarnation, it was a *scriptlet/bookmarklet* to save quick notes when the system is about to crash, or power is being cut. Field tested in harsh conditions, the method has proved reliable after over 1,000 unexpected shutdowns and electrical failures which sadly are part and parcel to life in the 3rd world. 


### :radio_button: Siblings
Firenote has many incarnations, Firenote SQL, Firenote LiveNotes, QuickNote. each a little different but singular in focus. These versions are floating about, some  live on multiple domains, embedded in blogs, self contained bookmarklet scripts. While usually persisting data using local storage, other editions focus on file download/exporting, Firebase syncing, Google Drive integrations, Github Gist upload, some include Chat, Video Conferencing, Voice Search and Voice Dictation, and more...
