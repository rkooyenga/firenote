# FireðŸ”¥Note

Firenote is a no bullshit note taker, text editor. It relies on local storage for fast and resilient saving of data. 

ðŸ”§ It's built lean. Vanilla Javascript and CSS, no JQuery, no Bootstrap, no heavy dependencies. 

ðŸ“¡ Field Tested

ðŸ’½ Uses Local Storage

### :radio_button: Siblings
Firenote has had many incarnations over the years (Firenote SQL, Firenote LiveNotes, QuickNote, etc). It has existing originally as javascript bookmarklet or datauri vs hosted on domains. And the various versions alternate between different persistence methods like Local Storage, Web SQL, Firebase, etc. So each a little different but singular in focus. These versions are floating about, some  live on multiple domains, embedded in blogs, self contained bookmarklet scripts. While usually persisting data using local storage, other editions focus on file download/exporting, Firebase syncing, Google Drive integrations, Github Gist upload, some include Chat, Video Conferencing, Voice Search and Voice Dictation, and more...    

### History
In it's earliest incarnation, it was a *scriptlet/bookmarklet* to save quick notes when the system is about to crash, or power is being cut. Field tested in harsh conditions, the method has proved reliable after over 1,000 unexpected shutdowns and electrical failures which sadly are part and parcel to life in the 3rd world. Living in Mexico I had electrical problems that were cutting my power off without warning sometimes 100x a week. When this happens whatever I was typing in any app was lost and backups hadnt had a chance to write to disk. For the time this was an issue out of frustration and desperation after repeatedly losing my work I experimented with a way to save things when I see a lightbulb flicker or get any sign whatsoever power is going out. 

Doubled use case was I also by tragic but kinda hilarious coincidence had a machine that was overheating and would restart when over tasked (something I get a warning about in advance in the form of extreme sluggishness). Yes, I had two distinct reasons why my machines would randomly reboot and kill all my work and the importance of said work which was high stakes, makes this problem all the funnier. The bookmarklet script was a great solution. Then I put an autosave timer on it with local storage. Then I moved it to a domain and from there started playing with other save methods for fun and learning. Most of those alternates have been lost to time but I keep this page/version around as a memory for how the project started and the reasons why as it was an adventurous period in my life.
