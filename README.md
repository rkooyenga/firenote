# FireðŸ”¥Note

Firenote is a no bullshit note taker, and lightweight text editor. It relies on local storage for fast resilient saving of data. 

ðŸ”§ It's built lean. Vanilla Javascript and CSS, no JQuery, no Bootstrap, no heavy dependencies. 

ðŸ“¡ Field Tested

ðŸ’½ Uses Local Storage


In it's earliest incarnation, it was a *scriptlet/bookmarklet* to save quick notes when the system is about to crash, or power is being cut. Field tested in harsh conditions, the method has proved reliable after over 1,000 unexpected shutdowns and electrical failures which sadly are part and parcel to life in the 3rd world. 

### :radio_button: Siblings
Firenote has many incarnations, Firenote SQL, Firenote LiveNotes, QuickNote. each a little different but singular in focus. These versions are floating about, some  live on multiple domains, embedded in blogs, self contained bookmarklet scripts. While usually persisting data using local storage, other editions focus on file download/exporting, Firebase syncing, Google Drive integrations, Github Gist upload, some include Chat, Video Conferencing, Voice Search and Voice Dictation, and more...
